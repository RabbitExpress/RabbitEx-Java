RabbitEx-Java
=============

So you want to get into async messaging, but there's a lot to learn and it takes too long. Well pick RabbitMQ and RabbitEx(press).
This will allow you to get up and running using a very simple Tibco RVesque subject based addressing system. Whats more is that it will be coming in mutiple languages, so if your shop is full of polyglots, they can all use the same library.
